to conect router
create a new file
.js file

copy all the methods
crud methods and paste it in separate file
delete in index file

then

import express from "express";
const router=express.Router();


before app.get


replace app.get with router.get

and at the end ,use 
export const moviesRouter=router;

in index.js
use import {moviesRouter} from "./routes/movies.js";
in import


and in index.js
app.use('./movies',moviesRouter)

after app.use(middleware)



we already have /movies in index.js
so removing /movies
example

 router.put("/movies/:id", async function (req, res)

replace with 
 router.put("/:id", async function (req, res)


client will be undefined in movies.js(the new file)

export const client = await createConnection(); in index.js
 and import {client} from "../index.js
